Explaining UKkonen's Algorithm 

1. For a given String text T, Ukkonen's algorithm starts with an empty Tree

2. Then it keeps on adding the N prefixes of T to the tree

3. It is a online algorithm since it scans from left to the right

4. Adding a new prefix to the tree is done by walking through the tree and visiting each of the suffix of the tree

5.
